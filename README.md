## 🏦 Loan Eligibility Prediction using Machine Learning

### 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan based on personal and financial information using machine learning models. It automates the decision-making process for financial institutions, improving efficiency and reducing manual effort.

The model was built and tested using a Jupyter Notebook with essential Python libraries and can be deployed in platforms like Azure ML Studio.
